# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new user first visits the app, they land on a simple, modern welcome page designed to introduce them to the concept of a universal gym membership. They are immediately prompted to sign in or create a new account. The registration process is straightforward, requiring basic personal information such as name, email, and a chosen password with additional verification using email confirmation. Users also have the option to reset forgotten passwords via a clearly marked 'Forgot Password' link that guides them through a secure recovery process. After account verification, users can log in using their email credentials, ensuring a smooth transition to the main functionality of the progressive web app. For those who already have an account, the sign-in page displays input fields for email and password along with options for social login if additional future integrations are introduced.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful login, users are taken to a central dashboard that serves as the home page. This page clearly displays navigation menus, headers, and interactive widgets that introduce the core features of the app. The dashboard provides an overview of the available subscription tiers grouped by pricing ranges from various gyms. The interface is designed with muted shades of blue and darker reds to reflect a professional yet inviting aesthetic. Navigation menus located on the sidebar clearly guide users to different sections such as subscription plans, gym search, class schedules, and a profile section where they can manage their account settings. The dashboard also integrates a search bar and an interactive map which allows users to quickly view gyms available in their geographical area, with filtering options to adjust the range of search results based on location.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

From the main dashboard, a user can begin by selecting a subscription tier. On the subscription page, all gyms grouped by pricing tiers are displayed with details about what each tier includes. The user can click on a tier to see further details about participating gyms and the classes available. Once they decide to select a particular tier, they proceed to a secure payment page where PayPal integration handles the recurring subscription payment. After confirming payment, the subscription is immediately activated and the user has access to the gym search functionality. In the gym search section, the user can adjust the radius filter around their current location to find nearby gyms within their selected tier. If they want more options or wish to upgrade their subscription, they can toggle to see gyms outside of their tier. When a user finds a gym of interest, they can click on the listing to view detailed information including class schedules for the day or week. From this detail page, booking a class is as simple as clicking a booking button, after which the system provides real-time booking confirmation, integrates the booking into the userâ€™s calendar, and reflects the change immediately on their schedule. Each page includes clear navigation options to return to the main dashboard or to move forward into further details, ensuring every step of the user journey is fully connected.

For gym partners, a separate but integrated dashboard is available. This dashboard allows gym partners to log into a specialized section where they can update gym pricing, manage class schedules, view analytics such as member attendance and duration of gym visits, and communicate with subscribers directly. While this dashboard is designed for gym partners, it shares a similar intuitive interface with the member-facing pages but includes additional modules for tracking engagement and statistics. Partners can also initiate messaging to subscribers on a per-message fee basis, with commission handling built into the system design. Partners are also provided an option for a direct message flow which is fully integrated into the communication system of the app, ensuring smooth transitions between routine analytics and promotional messaging.

## Settings and Account Management

Every user has access to an account settings page where they can manage personal information, change their password, and update preferences such as notification settings. The settings section is easily accessible from the main dashboard through a clearly labeled profile icon. In addition to basic settings, users can manage their subscriptions from this area, with options to cancel or modify their gym membership tiers. Payment details are stored securely, and users can review their billing history, upcoming payments, and adjust payment methods if necessary. After making any changes, a save confirmation ensures that the account is updated and the user is seamlessly brought back into the main app experience without interruption.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

In cases where users input invalid data, such as an incorrect email format during sign-up or a wrong password during login, clear and concise error messages appear directly on the page, instructing them on the required changes. If the application encounters connectivity issues when loading data, a friendly fallback page is presented to the user along with options to retry once connectivity is re-established. Situations such as payment processing failures also trigger a detailed error message explaining what went wrong and suggesting corrective actions, such as verifying payment details or contacting support. If a user attempts an action that is restricted, they are informed immediately with a clear message outlining the reason and steps to proceed or contact customer assistance. These fallback interactions ensure that the user is never left without guidance and can easily return to the normal flow of the app after resolving any issues.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall journey within this progressive web app is designed with simplicity and flexibility at its core. From the initial encounter on the signature landing page to a hassle-free registration process, users are seamlessly introduced to a platform that offers a universal gym membership through clear subscription tiers. After subscribing using PayPal, gym members can explore a well-integrated dashboard featuring interactive maps, detailed gym and class information, and flexible booking options. The app further accommodates gym partners by providing a dedicated dashboard for managing listings, tracking member statistics, and engaging in targeted communications. Error states and fallback pages are thoughtfully implemented to ensure users can navigate around issues and continue their journey without disruption. Ultimately, the app is built to provide an intuitive, connected experience that supports everyday gym-goers in managing their fitness routines while also empowering gym partners with useful analytics and communication tools.
