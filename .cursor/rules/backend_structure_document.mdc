# Backend Structure Document

This document outlines the backend architecture for our progressive web app that offers a universal gym membership. Below you will find an easy-to-understand description of key backend components, including how our system is built to be scalable, maintainable, and secure for both individual gym members and partner gyms.

## 1. Backend Architecture

Our backend is built using a modular approach with the following key frameworks and design patterns:

- **Framework:**
  - Node.js serves as the server, handling API requests, business logic, and integration with third-party services such as PayPal.

- **Design Patterns:**
  - Modular code structure to separate services (authentication, payment, class booking, dashboards) ensuring maintainability.
  - RESTful API design that allows clear communication between the frontend and backend.
  - Use of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure user sessions and API access.

- **Scalability & Performance:**
  - The architecture supports scalability by organizing backend services into discrete modules that can be scaled independently.
  - Efficient load handling is implemented through the use of caching and a cloud-based infrastructure, ensuring quick response times even at high usage.

## 2. Database Management

Our application uses a combination of technologies for structured data and file storage:

- **Database Technology:**
  - **Supabase:** This is used as our main SQL database (backed by PostgreSQL) to store data related to users, gym details, subscription tiers, class schedules, and analytics.

- **Key Data Management Practices:**
  - Data is stored in a structured format using relational tables to maintain consistency and integrity.
  - Regular backups and data validation routines are set up to preserve data accuracy as gym partners update pricing, location, and scheduling information.
  - Access to data is managed through secure APIs that enforce proper authentication and authorization protocols.

## 3. Database Schema

### Human Readable Format

Our database schema is organized into several key areas:

- **Users Table:** Stores member details such as email, password (encrypted), and profile information.
- **Gyms Table:** Contains details about each gym including pricing, location, available classes, and schedule information.
- **Subscription Tiers Table:** Defines the pricing tiers which group gyms by similar pricing ranges (e.g., affordable, medium, premium).
- **Bookings Table:** Records class bookings made by users, including dates, times, and gym identification.
- **Analytics Table:** Holds records of gym partners’ analytics such as visit frequency, duration of visits, and engagement metrics.
- **Partner Dashboard Table:** Manages gym partner data such as communication logs, subscription engagements, and commission records.

### Example SQL Schema (PostgreSQL)

Below is a simplified version of the database schema in SQL format:

-------------------------------------------------
-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Gyms Table
CREATE TABLE gyms (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    pricing DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    location GEOGRAPHY(Point, 4326),
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Subscription Tiers Table
CREATE TABLE subscription_tiers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    tier_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    min_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    max_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);

-- Bookings Table
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    gym_id INT REFERENCES gyms(id),
    booking_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    class_details TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Analytics Table
CREATE TABLE analytics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    gym_id INT REFERENCES gyms(id),
    visit_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    visit_duration INT, -- in minutes
    visit_count INT
);

-- Partner Dashboard (Communication & Commission) Table
CREATE TABLE partner_dashboard (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    gym_id INT REFERENCES gyms(id),
    message TEXT,
    commission DECIMAL(10,2),
    sent_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
-------------------------------------------------

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

Our APIs are designed with a RESTful approach to ensure simplicity and clear separation of concerns between client and server.

- **Design Approach:**
  - RESTful endpoints with clear naming conventions that represent resources (e.g., /users, /gyms, /subscriptions, /bookings).
  - Use of HTTP methods: GET for retrieving data, POST for creating new entries, PUT/PATCH for updates, and DELETE for removals.
  - JWT-based authentication protects sensitive routes and endpoints.

- **Key Endpoints:**

  - **User Authentication & Management:**
    - POST /auth/register: Create a new account.
    - POST /auth/login: Log in a user and provide a JWT token.
    - GET /users/profile: Retrieve user profile information (secured).

  - **Subscription Tiers & Payment:**
    - GET /subscriptions/tiers: List all available subscription tiers.
    - POST /subscriptions/subscribe: Process subscription sign-up and handle recurring payments (integrated with PayPal).
    - PATCH /subscriptions/cancel: Cancel an active subscription.

  - **Gym Search & Class Bookings:**
    - GET /gyms?location={lat,long}&radius={value}: Search for gyms based on location and radius filter.
    - GET /gyms/{gymId}/classes: Get the daily or weekly class schedule for a specific gym.
    - POST /bookings: Create a booking for a selected class.

  - **Partner Dashboard:**
    - GET /partners/dashboard: Retrieve analytics and engagement data for a partner gym.
    - PUT /partners/update: Update gym pricing, schedule, or details.
    - POST /partners/communicate: Send communication messages to subscribers (with commission tracking).

## 5. Hosting Solutions

Our hosting environment is designed to be reliable and scalable, meeting the needs of both high user engagement and data-intensive operations.

- **Cloud Providers & Platform:**
  - We are leveraging cloud hosting (for example, AWS) for both our application server and our file storage using AWS S3.
  - This choice ensures high availability, flexible scaling based on user demand, and cost-effectiveness with a pay-as-you-go model.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Reliability:** Cloud providers offer redundancy and backup features to minimize downtime.
  - **Scalability:** Resources can be dynamically allocated as the platform grows in user base and data volume.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

The backend infrastructure is reinforced by several key components to ensure seamless performance:

- **Load Balancers:**
  - Distribute incoming requests across multiple Node.js application servers to prevent overload and improve response times.

- **Caching Mechanisms:**
  - Employ caching techniques (e.g., in-memory caches or Redis) to store frequently accessed data such as gym lists and subscription data.

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):**
  - Use CDNs to quickly serve static assets stored in AWS S3, reducing latency for global users.

- **Serverless Functions:**
  - In some aspects, certain tasks (like processing analytics or handling periodic data updates) can be delegated to serverless functions, which run only when needed.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is a top priority throughout our backend. Key measures include:

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - All sensitive endpoints are protected using JWT-based authentication.
  - Role-based access is implemented to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., gym partners) can access specific endpoints like the partner dashboard.

- **Data Encryption:**
  - Data in transit is encrypted using standard HTTPS protocols, while sensitive data is stored encrypted in the database.

- **Secure Payment Processing:**
  - Integration with PayPal is done with security best practices in mind, ensuring that payment details are meditated and processed in a secure environment.

- **Regular Audits & Updates:**
  - The system is regularly audited for potential vulnerabilities, and security patches are promptly applied.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

To keep the backend healthy and performing at its best, the following tools and practices are put in place:

- **Performance Monitoring:**
  - Tools such as New Relic or AWS CloudWatch monitor server performance, response times, and error rates in real-time.

- **Logging:**
  - Comprehensive logging of backend activities is maintained to track user interactions, system errors, and performance bottlenecks.

- **Routine Maintenance:**
